# --- STARTER CODE: modify below this line ---

shopping_list = []

print("Enter items for your shopping list.")
print("Type 'remove' to delete an item, or 'done' to finish.")

# TODO: use a while loop to keep asking for input
# Inside the loop:
#   - if the user types 'done', stop the loop
#   - if the user types 'remove', ask for the item to remove
#   - otherwise, add the item to the shopping_list

# Example steps:
# 1) item = input("Enter item: ")
# 2) check what item equals
# 3) use if / elif / else for the three cases above

# After the loop:
# - print the list of items
# - print the number of items
# - print a message saying whether "milk" is in the list
